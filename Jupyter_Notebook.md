### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python


# This a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers.
result = (3 * 4) + 5
print("Result:", result)

# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.
minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
print("Hours:", hours)

**Objectives:**
- List popular languages for Data Science
- Identify commonly used libraries in Data Science
- Introduce some open-source Data Science tools
